# Rebuild log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. One entry per claim, completion, pause, contract change or decision. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD  <KIND> <task-id>  (<model or owner>)
What was done / decided, commands run, results (pass/fail counts, measurements), what is left.
```

KIND is one of `CLAIM`, `DONE`, `PAUSED`, `FAILED`, `CONTRACT`, `DECISION`, `NOTE`. See [REBUILD-PLAN.md](REBUILD-PLAN.md) §9.

## 2026-09-22  DECISION D1–D4  (owner)
Editor removed; 6-DOF chassis; authored 3D tracks; old track format, records and ghosts not carried forward. The CLAUDE.md "don't replace the custom solver" rule is withdrawn. D5–D10 proceed on the plan's defaults until the owner says otherwise.

## 2026-09-22  NOTE pre-rebuild state  (Claude Opus 5.5)
- The workspace is **not a git repository** (no `.git` in `godot/` or the root), although the docs cite commit hashes. P0-01 must resolve this first.
- `godot/.godot/` import cache was missing; regenerated with `--headless --import` (962 resources). Without it the parse check exits 0 but prints font preload errors to stderr.
- Suites on the current code: check-only clean; laps PASS (Monza 261.504 s, Spa 325.175 s); handling 23/0; dynamics 36/0; validation 103/0.
- `build/RacingSim.exe` re-exported 19:24 (110,258,384 bytes); exported `-- --features` 260 checks, 0 failures.
- `export_presets.cfg` references `tools/windows_debug_x86_64.exe`, which does not exist (release export unaffected).

## 2026-09-22  DONE P0-01  (Claude Opus 5.5)
No earlier history exists (the only other repo on the machine, `Desktop/Game`, is an unrelated Electron project with no commits), so this is a fresh repository at the workspace root, branch `main`.
- Commit `Pre-rebuild baseline`, annotated tag `pre-rebuild`. 307 tracked files. Local identity: Zain <zainyasin0723@gmail.com>. No remote.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.godot/`, engine binaries/templates/toolchains in `godot/tools/`, build exes/zips/`macos/`, generated test screenshots/logs/result JSON/capture rounds, root `godot/*.log`, and `godot/reference/` (copyrighted GT4/NFSU2 study images; not to be distributed).
- `.gitattributes` enforces LF (some files were CRLF; working copies re-checked-out as LF). Binary assets marked binary.
- After normalization: check-only clean (empty stderr), handling 23/0, dynamics 36/0.
- **Fresh clones need** Godot 4.6.2 at `godot/tools/Godot.exe` and the release template at `godot/tools/windows_release_x86_64.exe` (not in git), then `--headless --import`.
- Next: P0-03 (baseline capture), P0-04 (legacy exe copy). Pushing to a private remote (e.g. GitHub) is recommended so all models share one origin.
